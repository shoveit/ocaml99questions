1. install utop (enhenced REPL), merlin, tuareg (in emacs), make it so much easier
2. merlin
   + ctr + TAB -> auto-comp
   + C-c + C-t -> type sig
3. tuareg
   + C-c + C-e -> eval
   + run-ocaml
the 4 key combos saves a lot of trouble.

1. Batterries-include is a collection of good modules, the community's working hard to make it portable.
2. Core by JaneStreet is alternative to Ocaml standard library, later.
3. Compile
   + camlc   -> bytecode
   + camlopt -> native code
   native code object files produced by ocamlopt cannot be loaded in the toplevel system OCAML
